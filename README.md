# Java
Some stuff that I learnt (not in order)
---------------------------------------

JDK = Java Development Kit - contains developer tools to help code.
JRE = Java Runtime Environment - contains library, toolkits.
JVM = Java Virtual Machine - translates byte code to machine code.

Primitive data types
- 8 types (boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char)
- stores data
- can only hold 1 value 
- less memory 
- fast

Reference data type
- unlimited (user defined)
- stores an address
- could hold more than 1 value
- more memory
- slower
